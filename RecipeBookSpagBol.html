                <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
                <img src="Images/spagbol1.png">
                <p>This simple sauce was the first thing my dad ever taught me when I wanted to learn how to cook, and it reallt sparked my love of cooking from the get-go. It's reletively cheap, really simple, really quick (with the right ingredients), and overall a great recipe for beginners to try their hand at.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Step 1</dt>
                        <dd>Prepare your ingredients; Dice your onion/spring onions; mince your garlic clove; <span class = "veggie">chop up any vegetables you intend to use</span>. Fill 1 pot halfway with water and put it on a medium heat.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 2</dt>
                        <dd>Add the oil to the second pot, put it over a high heat, and add your mince meat. Do not pre-heat the pan as this can cause burning; let it heat up from room tempreture. If you choose to add another raw meat, e.g. chicken, add that too. Cook both until they are no longer raw/pink. <span class = "veggie">If you choose not to use meat, skip this step.</span></dd>
                    <dt>Step 3</dt>
                        <dd>Turn  down the heat and add onion, garlic, and any hard vegetables (i.e. carrot and bell pepper) to the pot. Saute until the onions become opaque.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 3</dt>
                        <dd>Add the can of chopped tomato to the pan, stir thuroughly, then add the seasonings. Note that the flavour will be less potant thsn the finished product, as later you will boil the water away which will make it less dilute. With this in mind, have a taste and adjust how you see fit. If you chose to add in a cooked meat, add it now.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 4</dt>
                        <dd>Allow the sauce to come to a boil, then turn down the heat to low, or to a temperature that allows the sauce to steam and gently boil. Add softer vegetables now (i.e. spinach, other leafy greens, or courgette)
                        <br>
                        The second pan of water should be boiling, or nearly boiling by now, if not, turn up the heating. Add the spagetti to the water.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 5</dt>
                        <dd>Allow the sauce to boil and reduce. It should take about 10 minutes, which is also around the time when your spaghetti will be fully cooked, however this depends on the brand, so try tasting a strand to double-check first after the 10 minutes have past.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 6</dt>
                        <dd>Once your sauce has reduced to a point where there is very little water, and your spaghetti has cooked through, it's ready to serve. Sieve the spaghetti to remove the water and put seperate them into 2 bowls, followed by the sauce. Sprinkle some cheese over the top if you want, then serve and enjoy.</dd>
