                My name's Markus, I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades; dabbling in art, design, mathematics, creative writing, music, and of course, cooking. I'm currently doing a computing course, but I have many different aspirations for the future.
                <br><br>
                Cooking has been a part of my life since I was a child; making scrambled eggs in the microwave and chopping up apples and peeling oranges to make a fruit salad. I grew up watching cooking shows and being encouraged to experiment with flavours and different cuisines.
                <br><br>
                I didn't really do much cooking for a few years, but my calling card came in 2017 when I enrolled on NCS and had to douse all of my meals in hot sauce to make them even slightly edible. I asked my dad, the chef of the house, what the easiest recipe he knows was, which was a <a href = "RecipeBookSpagBol.html">simple spaghetti sauce recipe</a>, which, when I made a spaghetti bolognese better than my dad's ever made, boosted my confidence in the kitchen tenfold.</p>
