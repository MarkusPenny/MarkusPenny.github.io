                <p>Chicken fried rice is a classic, and for good reason; it's very hard to make badly, which is why it was one of the first recipes I learned before I delved into experimenting.</p>

                <h2>Method</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Step 1</dt>
                        <dd>Prepare youe ingredients; slice the chicken thin, mince the garlic, and chop up the spring onions.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 2</dt>
                        <dd>place the wok on a medium heat and add the oil and chicken. Fry the chicken until it is fully cooked.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 3</dt>
                        <dd>Add the spring onions, sweetcorn, peas, and broccoli if you choose to have them in your meal. If some of the vegetables are frozen, allow them to thaw in the heat of the pan before continuing.</dd>
                    <dt>Is it burning?</dt>
                        <dd>Sometimes you may notice a bit of a brown tint on the bottom of the pan when cooking this dish, and you may believe it to be burnt food, but it's just a bit of caramalization on the bottom of your pan. When you add the soy sauce in the following step, this will deglaze the pan, getting rid of the brown tint with a bit of a scrub from your mixing spoon, giving your chicken fried rice a delightful extra depth of flavour.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 4</dt>
                        <dd>Add the rice, mix everything together, then mix in the seasonings; soy sauce, ginger powder, garlic, and pepper.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 5</dt>
                        <dd>If you choose to make this a chicken and egg fried rice, make a dip in the middle and add two gently whisked eggs into it. Allow the eggs to solidify a little before breaking it up and mixing in a bit of rice. Continue to break up the egg and mix in the rice until the egg is fully dispersed.</dd>
                    <dt>Step 6</dt>
                        <dd>Once everything is thoroughly mixed in, your meal is ready to serve.</dd>
